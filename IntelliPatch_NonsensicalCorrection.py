IntelliPatch_NonsensicalCorrection.py

This script implements the NonsensicalCorrectionSystem, part of the IntelliPatch framework.
Its purpose is to detect and correct nonsensical elements in AI-generated responses, ensuring
relevant, coherent, and concise outputs. The system applies targeted patches to improve
response quality and logs feedback for continuous refinement.

Modules:
- NonsensicalDetectionModule: Detects off-topic content, contradictions, and complexity issues.
- CorrectionPatchingModule: Applies targeted patches to address detected issues.
- FeedbackLearningModule: Logs feedback for learning and future improvements.

Usage:
- Initialize the NonsensicalCorrectionSystem with a query and initial response.
- The system detects nonsensical elements, applies corrections, and returns a refined response.
